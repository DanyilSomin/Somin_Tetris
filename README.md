# Somin_Tetris

My tetris clone with **different difficulty levels, statistics, music, sounds, settings and main, pause and game over menus.**
Written in C++ using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org) and [json-parser](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) library.

**This is my educational project. Here are the goals that I set for myself to realize:**
- **Multiple game screens** and ability to move between them.
- **Saving statistics and settings** for future sessions.
- The scoring and level system similar to the classic tetris games.
- The ability to **easily expand** the gameplay by **adding split screen PvP** mode 
(this may be needed in the future for a university project).
- Hotkeys
